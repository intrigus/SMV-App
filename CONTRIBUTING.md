### Eclipse Formatter

If you work on the app's code, we require you to use the [Eclipse formatter](https://github.com/smv-am-mpg/smv-app/blob/master/eclipse-formatter.xml) located in the root directory of the repository.

If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, you can still make use of the eclipse code formatter:
